# Shanti - Mental Wellness & Mindfulness Companion

## Name of the domain:
**Health & Personal Growth - Mental Wellness**

## The Problem:
In today's fast-paced world, mental health challenges are increasingly common, yet many people lack easy access to:
- Immediate emotional support during difficult moments
- Tools to track and understand their emotional patterns
- Guided mindfulness and meditation practices
